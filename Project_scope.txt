Scope

Ingestion & Storage

  Central data lake on Amazon S3 (raw / curated / feature zones).

  Ingest batch historical tables via AWS Glue jobs or AWS DMS (if migrating DB).

  Stream POS/near-real-time events via Amazon Kinesis Data Streams → S3 or Lambda.

  External connectors (weather, festival, macro) ingested with AWS Lambda scheduled by EventBridge.

Catalog & Governance

  Data catalog & schema discovery with AWS Glue Data Catalog (optionally Lake Formation for access control).

  S3 bucket versioning + AWS KMS encryption & fine-grained IAM policies.

Data Quality & Feature Engineering

  Scheduled ETL/transform in AWS Glue (PySpark) or EMR for heavy transforms.

  Feature store or feature table staging in S3 / Amazon Redshift or SageMaker Feature Store.

  Data-quality checks and anomaly flags implemented in Glue/EMR jobs (rules + CloudWatch alerts).

Modeling & Forecasting

  Use Amazon Forecast for baseline/time-series models (fast path) and Amazon SageMaker for custom models (advanced).

  Feature pipelines in SageMaker Pipelines or Glue → store model inputs in Feature Store/S3.

  Explainability with SageMaker Clarify or SHAP via SageMaker notebooks.

Training, Retraining & MLOps

  Automated training & retraining pipelines using SageMaker Pipelines + EventBridge triggers.

  Model registry & versioning with SageMaker Model Registry.

  Model monitoring & drift detection with SageMaker Model Monitor and CloudWatch metrics.

  CI/CD for ML code using CodeCommit / CodeBuild / CodePipeline (optional).

Inference & Integration

  Online inference via SageMaker Real-time Endpoints or serverless inference (Lambda + API Gateway) for low concurrency.

  Batch forecast exports (CSV/Parquet) to S3 via scheduled jobs (Glue / Lambda / Batch).

  ERP/order system integration via secure API endpoints (API Gateway + Lambda) or SFTP to ERP ingestion point.

Replenishment & Scenario Engines

  Replenishment recommendation microservice (Lambda) that consumes forecasts and business rules; outputs orders to ERP.

  Simple scenario runner (e.g., “festival + price drop”) implemented as Lambda/Step Functions that runs forecasts with alternate inputs.

Lightweight UI

  Small web app for operations: React single-page app hosted on S3 + CloudFront.

  Auth with Amazon Cognito.

  UI pages: upload/monitor data jobs, view latest forecasts (table + CSV download), run basic what-if scenarios, view model status & retrain button.

  UI talks to backend APIs (API Gateway → Lambda → S3 / SageMaker).

Monitoring, Alerts & Ops: Operational logs, metrics and alarms via CloudWatch + SNS notifications.

Security & Compliance : Least-privilege IAM roles, VPC endpoints for S3 and Glue, and audit logs in CloudTrail.

Deliverables

  S3 data lake skeleton + sample ingest jobs (Glue + Lambda).

  At least one working forecasting pipeline: (a) ingest → (b) feature prep → (c) train (Forecast or SageMaker) → (d) serve.

  Lightweight React UI with auth that can: show forecasts, trigger retrain, run a scenario, and download CSV.

  Automated retrain trigger and basic model monitor (drift alert).

  README with architecture diagram, deployment steps (IaC like CloudFormation/SAM) and runbook.
